## Please take note that this is still a v0.1 so there could be bugs and unexpected errors. Any kind of feedback is appriciated.

## Usage:
* Enter a valid cardano address
* Or enter a valid ergo address

## Future plans:
* List the share based on the assets in the LISO
* E.g.: Total: 50$, BTC: 20$, ADA: 10$, ERG: 10$, etc...
