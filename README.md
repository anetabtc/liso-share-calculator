# LISO share calculator v0.1

## Please take note that this is still a v0.1 so there could be bugs and unexpected errors. Any kind of feedback is appreciated.

## Usage:
* Enter a valid cardano address
* Or enter a valid ergo address
* Or enter your Neta holdings(cneta + neta)
* The formula: Total value of the LISO / Total Neta Supply * Your neta amount

## Future plans:
* List the share based on the assets in the LISO
* E.g.: Total: 50$, BTC: 20$, ADA: 10$, ERG: 10$, etc...
* Create a graph with these values
* Display cneta and neta price
